      <h3 class="headline">Watching saving private Ryan when my dad upslapped side of ma head</h3>
          <p>He said to me that I would never join the army, and this was when I was about I want to say maybe 13 or 14?
             Nevertheless, I snapped back that I would if I needed to.</p>
      <h3>& that was it</h3>
          <p>I finished school and I had my paper round from 12 until I was 15 or 16 maybe. I remember signing on once,
             literally one time and I felt like a bum. I hated that feeling going into the job centre and signing on for
             jobseekers allowance. At some point I headed into Birmingham for the careerss office and I remember speaking to
             Scott Brettle I believe. I said I'd like to join the army and he handed me a piece of paper or something that
             said I had to pick 3 options on what I'd like to do in the army. So, naturally I said;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Tank Regiment</li>
        <li>I forget option 2 and 3</li>
      </ol>
          <p>I remember him saying something along the lines of good choice. But what about joining the elite guards.
             Specifically the Irish Guards. I asked what they did and he told me that they;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We were an Infantry Regiment (1 of 5 [further listed below])</li>
        <li>We served the Queen (and stood outside Buckingham Palace)</li>
        <li>We went abroad for training (the likes of BATUK/BATUS)</li>
    <div class="batukindent">(BATUK is British Army Training Unit Kenya / Suffield)</div>
        <li>Adventure training in Canada or Cyprus (amongst other places)</li>
      </ul>
          <p>Naturally I was intrigued by the prospect of working in a "red coat" as it were and "big hat" outside the
             palace. I signed as soon as I could. In the mean time they sent me to Hall Green College in order to get some
             military background knowledge and do laps of a field, my gosh that <b>hurt!</b>. I ended up throwing up on more
             than one occasion. I had to come back to do some
             simple math and english tests and some eye tests I think? from there I passed these and had to go to Lichfield
             for some fitness test known as the BPFA at the time if I recall correctly. 13mins and 30 seconds to do a mile
             and half run, situps needed was 60 as wass press up. I mean I forget the exact number for press ups and sit
             ups.I honestly cant remember if we was told on site if we had passed or not.
          </p>
          <p>I barely remember the day I got on the train to head to Darlaston in Yorkshire. Upon getting off the train our
        Military corrospondant as such was on the train platform ready for us to arrive, and direct us outside and onto
        the coaches. I think to start with when we got to Helles barracks there was about 150 of us?</p>
        <p>From here we got haircuts, (the good old shaven head back then September 2004]) We then did a somewhat chaotic march over to Vimy barrack to visit the Quartermaster to be kitted out with clothing and an un-godly amount of kit. Boots, Uniform (the old 95 combats at the time) as well as number 2 dress as seen here <img src="#"> back in 2004 we didn't get issued the tunic aand bearskins etc. In training we had to have fun where we could. at some point through training my platoon sgt played machine gun fire over his speakers and when grenade was shouted we dropped down and this was fun, I say 'fun' lightly mind.</p>

<!-- intro ex decent explaination
   The first few weeks at the Infantry Training Centre, Catterick go by quickly as there’s a lot to do. It can be a shock to the system at the start as you begin the process of going from civilian to solider.

Week 1 can be a bit boring, as there’s a lot of waiting around. There’s a lot of administration and paperwork to do. Everyone is nervous as they begin the introduction to the Army way of life.

Some people get a bit homesick – especially the younger recruits, as they have not lived away from home before. The shock of introduction to Army life goes away after the first couple of weeks, once you get used to the routine.

Towards the end of week 1 and the start of week 2 the pace picks up. There’s a lot to learn in a short space of time. Everything you learn is progressive and as the weeks go on all the information you learn is built upon and you can see the progression.

The first exercise is good fun as you learn the basics of living in the field. When we did it there were high winds and it was raining. But it was still good fun, except for doing sentry duty in the pitch black. You cannot see anything!

After Intro Ex 1 the pace of life continues to increase, there are more lessons in the classroom learning various things such as military law and there are also rifle lessons which are always good fun. The standards expected of you in your locker lay out and standard of dress also increase with each passing week.

In week 4 you have your weapon handling test to see if you are competent with the rifle. Intro Ex 2 is a chance to improve on the skills you learned in Intro Ex 1 and you learn more fieldcraft too. You also get to fire your rifle for the first time which is great. We did fire and movement, which was tiring but also good fun.

After Intro Ex 2 the focus switches to the week 5 drill test. You need to pass this to gain your regimental beret and also get a long weekend at home. It involves a few late nights and early morning as you need to prepare for the OC’s inspection. We passed both his  inspection and the drill test and it was a great feeling to get the beret and relax on a long weekend.
