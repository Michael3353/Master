      <h3 class="headline">Watching saving private Ryan when my dad upslapped side of ma head</h3>
          <p>He said to me that I would never join the army, and this was when I was about I want to say maybe 13 or 14?
             Nevertheless, I snapped back that I would if I needed to.</p>
      <h3>& that was it</h3>
          <p>I finished school and I had my paper round from 12 until I was 15 or 16 maybe. I remember signing on once,
             literally one time and I felt like a bum. I hated that feeling going into the job centre and signing on for
             jobseekers allowance. At some point I headed into Birmingham for the careerss office and I remember speaking to
             Scott Brettle I believe. I said I'd like to join the army and he handed me a piece of paper or something that
             said I had to pick 3 options on what I'd like to do in the army. So, naturally I said;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Tank Regiment</li>
        <li>I forget option 2 and 3</li>
      </ol>
          <p>I remember him saying something along the lines of good choice. But what about joining the elite guards.
             Specifically the Irish Guards. I asked what they did and he told me that they;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We were an Infantry Regiment (1 of 5 [further listed below])</li>
        <li>We served the Queen (and stood outside Buckingham Palace)</li>
        <li>We went abroad for training (the likes of BATUK/BATUS)</li>
    <div class="batukindent">(BATUK is British Army Training Unit Kenya / Suffield)</div>
        <li>Adventure training in Canada or Cyprus (amongst other places)</li>
      </ul>
          <p>Naturally I was intrigued by the prospect of working in a "red coat" as it were and "big hat" outside the
             palace. I signed as soon as I could. In the mean time they sent me to Hall Green College in order to get some
             military background knowledge and do laps of a field, my gosh that <b>hurt!</b>. I ended up throwing up on more
             than one occasion. I had to come back to do some
             simple math and english tests and some eye tests I think? from there I passed these and had to go to Lichfield
             for some fitness test known as the BPFA at the time if I recall correctly. 13mins and 30 seconds to do a mile
             and half run, situps needed was 60 as wass press up. I mean I forget the exact number for press ups and sit
             ups.I honestly cant remember if we was told on site if we had passed or not.
          </p>
          <p>I barely remember the day I got on the train to head to Darlaston in Yorkshire. Upon getting off the train our
        Military corrospondant as such was on the train platform ready for us to arrive, and direct us outside and onto
        the coaches. I think to start with when we got to Helles barracks there was about 150 of us?</p>
